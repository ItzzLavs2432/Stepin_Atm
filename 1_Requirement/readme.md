## ATM MINI PROJECT
## INTRODUCTION
ATM means Automated Teller Machine.The software to be designed will control a simulated automated teller machine (ATM) having a magnetic stripe reader for reading an ATM card, a keyboard and display for interaction with the customer, a slot for depositing envelopes, a dispenser for cash , a printer for printing customer receipts, and a key-operated switch to allow an operator to start or stop the machine. The ATM will communicate with the bank's computer over an appropriate communication link.
## The ATM must be able to provide the following services to the customer: 
 A customer must be able to make a cash withdrawal from any suitable account linked to the card, in multiples of $20.00. Approval must be obtained from the bank before cash is dispensed. 
 A customer must be able to make a deposit to any account linked to the card, consisting of cash and/or checks in an envelope. The customer will enter the amount of the deposit into the ATM, subject to manual verification when the envelope is removed from the machine by an operator. Approval must be obtained from the bank before physically accepting the envelope. 
 A customer must be able to make a transfer of money between any two accounts linked to the card. 4. A customer must be able to make a balance inquiry of any account linked to the card.
## CONDITIONS: 
The following conditions must follow:
|CON-NO|CONDITION DESCRIPTION|
|-----|----------------------|
|CON-1| The ATM only dispense multiplies of Rs.500.|
|CON-2| The card inserted into the ATM is valid.|
|CON-3| Communication between the ATM and CBS is secure and valid.|

|CON-5| The ATM does not handle credit cards or any other non bank cards.|
|CON-6| If a user has a bank card, then the user has a bank account that can be withdrawn from and deposited to. CON NO-7 Any account can have only one associated bank card.|
## REQUIREMENTS: 
A thing that is necessary. 
A necessary condition.
## TYPES: 
1. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
2. NON - FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: 
These requirements are observable tasks or processes that must be performed by the system under development. A functional requirement of an automated teller machine,”must process withdrawals and dispense cash to the customer”. Functional requirements are labeled FR-x.Where FR stands for Functional requirements and x is a unique identifying integer. 
|ATM-FR-X|ATM FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS|
|--------|---------------------------|
|ATM-FR-1|The card reader determines the account numberfrom the entered card.|
|ATM-FR-2|The ATM is in the idle state when there is no operation.|
|ATM-FR-3|The user is prompted to enter a PIN after a card is entered.|
|ATM-FR-4|A menu is displayed to the user with the following options:Withdraw, Deposit, Paybill,Account update and Exit.|
|ATM-FR-5|The cash dispenser has the ability to dispense cash.|
|ATM-FR-6|A transaction record can be printed upon demand|
|ATM-FR=7|The card is rejected when the session is completed.|
|ATM-FR-8|The envelope feeder accepts envelops.|
|ATM-FR-9|The envelope feeder is aware when an envelope has been inserted.|
|ATM-FR-10| The printer determines whether there is sufficient paper and ink.|
|ATM-FR-11|The ATM defaults to the idle state.|
|ATM-FR-12|Transactions can be canceled at any prompt by the user pressing the cancel button.|
## NON - FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: 
These requirements are qualities or standards that the system under development must have or comply with, but which are not tasks that will be
automated by the system.For example non-functional requirements for a system include:”system must be built for a total installed cost of $10,50,000;”system must be secured against Trojan attacks”. Non-Functional requirements are labeled NFR-x .Where NFR stands for Non functional requirements and x stands for it is a unique identifying integer.
|ATM-NFR-X|ATM-NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS|
|---------|--------------------------------|
|ATM-NFR-1|The ATM unit consists of a display, a card reader, a cash dispenser,an envelope,drawer,an envelope slot,a keypad and a pointer.|
|ATM-NFR-2|The keypad is a set of buttons that include the following:10 Buttons labelled with numbers 0 to 9,an OKAY button, a CLEAR button,a CANCEL button and dynamic buttons that performs different actions.|
|ATM-NFR-3|A PIN must be entered with in 20 seconds.|
|ATM-NR-4|The user must enter the PIN within three attempts.|
|ATM-NFR-5|ATM suspends further access using a particular card if the associated PIN is entered incorrectly 3 times in succession.|
|ATM-NFR-6|The ATM must be secure.|
|ATM-NFR-7|The ATM can be shut down and restarted.|
|ATM-NFR-8|The envelope drawer can beopened and refilled with envelops.|
|ATM-NFR-9|The envelope feeder can beopened so many envelopsthat has been deposited can be removed.|
|ATM-NFR-10|The cash dispenser can be openedand refilled with cash.|
|ATM-NFR-11|The printer can be opened and refilled with paper.|
